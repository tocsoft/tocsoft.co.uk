This is supposed to be the start of my more open talking, I will be posting up blog posts
about projects I'm releasing as well as any other general musings I come up with.
<!--break-->

##Me
So I think I should start off with a little about me;

I live and work in [Birkenhead, UK](https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Birkenhead,+UK&hl=en&sll=53.389991,-3.023009&sspn=0.292786,0.684586&oq=Birkenhead&hnear=Birkenhead,+Merseyside,+United+Kingdom&t=m&z=11)

###Career
I work for a _Design, Digital, Social Change, What ever you want us to do_ Agency called
[ICE Creates](http://icecreates.com). I work as an application developer mainly concentrating
on web apps and site, with most of our project now a days being done using the [umbraco](http://umbraco.com) 
CMS, but we do other work too, we have released a few mobile apps written in Javascript using the Titanium Mobile 
framework, and also full on desktop client server applications.

###Home
As I've said I live in Birkenhead with my fantastic wife and our 2 gorgeous girls (2 and 4 almost 5), we 
own our own home and we even Let our another.

###Disclaimer
I'm a developer not a writer I apologise now for spelling mistakes and general lack of clarity, 
please feel free to comment and I'll try to clarify.
