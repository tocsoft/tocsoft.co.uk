This is supposed to be the start of my more open talking, I will be posting up blog posts
about projects I'm releasing as well as any other general musings I come up with.
<!--break-->

##Me
So I think I should start off with a little about me;

###Disclaimer
Firstly, I'm a developer not a writer 
I apologise now for spelling mistakes and general lack of clarity, please feel free to comment 
and I'll try to clarify.

###Career
Secondly, I think I should talk about about my career, I work for a _Design, Digital, Social 
Change, What ever you want us to do_ Agency called [ICE Creates](http://icecreates.com). I 
work as an application developer mainly concentrating on web apps and site, with most of our 
project now a days being done using the [umbraco](http://umbraco.com) CMS, but we do other 
work too, we have released a few mobile apps written in Javascript using the Titanium Mobile 
framework, and also full on desktop client server applications.
