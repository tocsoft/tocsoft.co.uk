SixLabors.Fonts is an true type/woff compatible font loading library written in c# and targets .netstandard 1.1 making it entirely crossplatform and will run on everything from android phone, to windows desktops, to linxus servers and everything in between. 

Fonts provides text measuring, layout, and abstracted rendering systems. You just need to plugin your own raserizer (like ImageSharp)
